# TASKS

    ## HTML
        adding/refining classes and IDs
        ensuring HTML is valid, clean, and semantic
        skeleton (css framework)


    ## CSS
        skeleton (css framework)
        styling
        fonts (if you don't want to use the default skeleton fonts)
        color scheme
        positioning and spacing elements
        you might need to get rid of play.css and just use style.css, the separation might be unnecessary


    ## JAVASCRIPT
        GoPerigon API (https://www.goperigon.com/) (API key: f52ad48a-9631-4f70-bcba-5913be0363a5)
            - You *might* need to make your own account, but that's fine because then we'll get more free API calls per month
            - function to get random article and its content
            - maybe let the user decide the topic of the randomly chosen article?
            - truncate article so it's only 4 - 6 sentences long (trying to reduce our number of API calls)

        Words API (https://www.wordsapi.com/) <-- see link for example calls. NO API KEY NEEDED!
            - blanking out random significant words from article (we can't be blanking words like "the" or "a"
                - blanking needs to be spaced out, maybe 0 to 2 blanks every sentence
                - you'll need to loop through and check
            - finding out what part of speech each blanked word is (verb, noun, adjective, etc.)
            - building a list in play.html (see assets/word-entry.drawio) to prompt user for each blanked word type


    ## PRESENTATION
        spokesperson (is there only going to be one? we could take turns presenting different parts)
        elevator pitch
        order and flow of presentation



    ## OTHER
        adding explanatory comments to the code
        making and refining the README
        ensuring proper naming conventions (file names, classes, IDs, variables, etc.)
